## Inspiration

I was going through [my custom RSS feed aggregator](https://github.com/tsar-boomba/my-feed) on a lazy Sunday when I encountered [an interesting 2021 blog post](https://cbarrete.com/rust-bad.html) about the author's dislikes of Rust. Even in 2025, I agree with all of the points they made in the post. The one issue that really stook out to me though, were the complaints about `impl` blocks in Rust.

## The Issue

Take the following, very standard, idiomatic Rust code:

```rs
struct Container<T> {
	data: T,
	metadata: usize,
}

impl<T> Container<T> {
	pub fn new(data: T) -> Self {
		// Construct Self 🏗️
	}

	pub fn do_something(&self) {
		// Code here 😁👍
	}

	pub fn transition<U>(&self) -> U {
		// Transition
	}
}
```

Looks pretty normal, especially to someone used to Rust. But to people less desensitized to the syntax, the `impl` block immediately adds a level of indentation to all member functions for `struct`s and `enum`s that really sticks out! This had never even occurred to me until I read that blog post, but now I can't unsee it. So what could we do better?

## My Proposal

I think we could have a syntax like this (forgive the poor highlighting):

```rs
pub fn Container<T>::new(data: T) -> Self {
	// Construction
}

pub fn Container<T>::do_something(&self) -> Self {
	// Something
}

pub fn Container<T>::transition<U>(&self) -> U {
	// Transition
}
```

I'm not super familiar with the internals of `rustc`, so I'm not sure of feasible this would even be, but to me, this is a massive improvement over the current `impl` block. There's no longer a base level of indentation for all items for the type. The main drawback, however, is now there's duplication of the type name and generic parameters. This could be alleviated a bit by allowing `_` to elide unused parameters.

## Conclusion

Overall, I'm pretty happy with how Rust's `impl` blocks work today (thanks to shorthand bounds), and wouldn't get behind this specific proposal, but it's always worth taking a second look and seeing what we might do better. Thanks for reading!
