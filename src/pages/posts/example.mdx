# Getting started with an example

```ts
console.log('ur mom');
type sus = {};
const amogus = 123;
// comment
const func = (param: string) => {};
function func2(param: number) {}
```

```rs file=src/main.rs
fn main() {
	let variable: i32 = 1;

    struct MyStruct<'a, T> {
    	property: &'a str
		generic: T
    }

	impl<'a, T: Clone> MyStruct<'a, T> {
		pub fn clone(&self) -> Self {
			self.clone()
		}
	}
}
```

```rust file=src/main.rs
fn main() {
	let sus = "baka";
}
```

This is some text for my paragraph. Yes I love Rust language it is really cool, but I also like TypeScript, so how can i use them otether?
