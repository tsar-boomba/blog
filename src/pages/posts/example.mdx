const Component = () => {
	return <div></div>;
};
```

```rust file=src/main.rs topLevel
fn main() {
	let variable: i32 = 1;
	let boolean: bool = false;

	struct MyStruct<'a, T> {
		property: &'a str
		generic: T
	}

	impl<'a, T: Clone> MyStruct<'a, T> {
		pub fn clone(&self, param: i32) -> Self {
			self.clone()
		}
	}
}
