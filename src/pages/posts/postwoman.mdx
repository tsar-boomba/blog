## Why?

Whenever new programmers first start out, it is often recommended that they use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test out their backends. It used to be a good choice, but over time it has become bloated with many unnecessary features that most people don't need.

My goal with this project is to create a lighter alternative to Postman, as well as to create a pleasing, and usable user interface in completely native Rust.
