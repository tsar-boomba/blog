## Inspiration

I was going through my RSS feed aggregator on a lazy Sunday when I encountered [an interesting 2021 blog post](https://cbarrete.com/rust-bad.html) about the author's dislikes of Rust. Even in 2025, I agree with all of the points they made in the post. The one issue that really stook out to me though, were the complaints about `impl` blocks in Rust.

## The Issue

Take the following, very standard, idiomatic Rust code:

```rs
struct Container<T> {
	data: T,
	metadata: usize,
}

impl<T> Container<T> {
	pub fn new(data: T) -> Self {
		// Construct Self 🏗️
	}

	pub fn do_something(&self) {
		// Code here 😁👍
	}
}
```

Looks pretty normal, especially to someone used to Rust. But to people less desensitized to the syntax, the impl block immediately adds a level of indentation to all member functions for `struct`s and `enum`s that really sticks out! This didn't bother me, since outside of Rust all I really know is TypeScript and Java
